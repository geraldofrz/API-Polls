## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

I created this API with the purpose of learning the use of WebSockets for real-time information exchange. It was a very interesting project and highly beneficial for personal growth, where I was able to grasp the usage well and learned a new pattern, which is the Pub/Sub pattern.
